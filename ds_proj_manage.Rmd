## Data Science "pipelines" and "life-cycles"

- The data science work-flow takes place within the organizational framework
- While "Data science" is oft used, its definitions vary
    - [Click here](https://remiller1450.github.io/s395s20/Using_Data.html) to see some examples of this
  
## CRISP-DM

We'll adopt the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model:

## Phase 1 - Business Understanding

Tasks:

1) Gather necessary [background information](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_business_criteria.htm)
2) Document specific [specific objectives](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_business_objectives.htm)
3) Determine [success criteria](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_success_criteria_business.htm) for the project

Each of these tasks should be undertaken in coordination with the client 

## Phase 1 - Objective vs. Subjective Success Criteria

- You should have a mixture of objective and subjective success criteria
    - Objective = "Increase the time visiters spend on the destinations page by 10%"
    - Subjective = "Identify customer clusters"
    
## Phase 2 - Data Understanding

Tasks:

1) [Describing](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_describe_data.htm) the data
2) [Exploring](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_explore_data.htm) the data
3) [Verifying data quality](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_verify_data_quality.htm)

These tasks should be carried out at the team level (and cross-referenced with the principal and client if necessary)

## Phase 3 - Data Preparation

Tasks:

- Merging/joining (ie: `left_join`)
- Selecting relevant subsets (ie: `filter`)
- Aggregating records (ie: `group_by` and `summarize`)
- Deriving new attributes (ie: `mutate`)
- Handling missing data (ie: `complete.cases` or `knnImput`/`rfImpute`)

These tasks should be carried out at the team level and cross-referenced by the principal (they are seldom relevant to the client at this point)

## Phase 4 - Modeling 

Tasks:

- [Selecting](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_select_model_technique.htm) a model
- [Evaluating the "goodness"](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_generate_test_design.htm) of a model
- [Building](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.crispdm.help/crisp_build_model.htm) the model
- Note: you may replace "model" with "product" in some applications

This phase is highly non-linear, it should be carried out at the team level and cross-referenced by the principal (and possibly with the client depending on their level of technical proficiency)

## Phase 5 - Evaluation 

Tasks:

1) Consider your model/product in regards to the business success criteria you came up with in Phase 1
2) Formalize your findings

These tasks should be undertaken in coordination with the client and principal

## Phase 6 - Deployment

Tasks:

1) Deliver your model/product to the client
2) Complete wrap-up tasks (ie: technical report, etc.)
