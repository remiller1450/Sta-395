### Introduction

In this class, it is presumed you are already familiar with: 

- At least one programming language (`R` or Python)
- Basic data visualizations (bar charts, scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, etc.)
- Fundamental statistical concepts (bias, confounding, probability, random chance, etc.)
- Basic statistical methods (descriptive statistics, regression, etc.)

That said, it is okay if you are a little rusty in one or more of these.  This activity will provide an opportunity for you to get to know your classmates and refresh yourself on the aforementioned topics.

### Directions

You will work in a group of 3 and will be given approximately 20 minutes to construct a data visualization and/or summary table supporting your response to a research question.  Note that this is an intentionally short amount of time, so your group should work efficiently.

In addition to creating your visual(s) or table(s) and crafting an answer to the research question, you should be prepared to discuss *how your team approached the task*, such as: Where did you start? Did you outline your plans before jumping in? How did you divide tasks? Were there areas where you could have been efficient? Were there areas where you should have spent more time?

### Prompt

You work as a data analyst for a large university and are tasked with preparing the university's administration for possible ligation regarding potential discrimination in the admissions to its graduate programs. In relation to this task, your goal is to evaluate possible gender discrimination, answering the question:

> Is there evidence of gender discrimination in the university's graduate program admissions?

To answer this question your group should:

- Prepare one or more visuals that clearly illustrate the important trends in the data
- Prepare a 1-3 sentence executive summary of what you'd report to university's administration

### Data
